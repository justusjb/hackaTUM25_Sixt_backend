You are a car rental assistant. Based on this customer data, create a decision tree of YES/NO questions to determine the best car upgrade options.

Customer Data:
{customer_data}

You MUST return ONLY a valid JSON object with NO markdown formatting, NO code blocks, NO explanations.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST include these exact 3 questions with their exact images:
   - "gear" with image "/ski-gear.jpg"
   - "alpine" with image "/alpine-pass.jpg"
   - "snow" with image "/snow-on-the-road.jpg"

2. You can EXTEND the tree by adding 2-5 additional questions
3. For any NEW questions you add, ALWAYS use the image "/empty.jpg"
4. null means END OF QUESTIONS - when a user reaches null, the questionnaire is complete
5. Create multiple paths through the tree with different endpoints (null values)

Example structure:
{{
    "snow": {{
    "id": 1,
    "key": "snow",
    "question": "Expecting snow on the roads?",
    "image": "/snow-on-the-road.jpg",
    "yes": "alpine",
    "no": null
  }},
  "alpine": {{
    "id": 2,
    "key": "alpine",
    "question": "Taking the high alpine passes?",
    "image": "/alpine-pass.jpg",
    "yes": "gear",
    "no": "gear"
  }},
  "gear": {{
    "id": 3,
    "key": "gear",
    "question": "All 3 of you bringing ski gear?",
    "image": "/ski-gear.jpg",
    "yes": null,
    "no": null
  }}
}}

Rules:
- MUST include "gear", "alpine", and "snow" with their exact images
- New questions must use "/empty.jpg" as image
- Each key must match its "key" field value
- null means "end of questionnaire" - this is a terminal node
- Questions must be YES/NO format about car rental needs (space, terrain, weather, 4WD, comfort, passengers)
- Create logical paths based on the customer data
- Aim for 5-8 total questions

Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown. No explanation. Just the JSON object.
